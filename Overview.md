1. The library I selected is the pygame library.

2. pygame is a very popular free and open-source cross-platform library used with the purpose of development of multimedia applications like video games using Python. With pygame we are able to use functions for rendering graphics, including images, shapes, and text [1] . Furthermore, we are able to add sound effects and music to our game and can load, play, or manipulate the audio of our choosing [1] . Finally, with pygame we can take user input from multiple souces, including mouse, game controller and keyboards [1] .  
To use pygame you must simply install it by typing "pip3 install pygame" into your terminal. From there you must import pygame into your program "import pygame" and initialize it using "pygame.init()" [2]. From there we are able to access all of functions included within pygame to help us with creating our game. However, before we start working on our game we must also create a "main loop" to display our game board until we want to exit[1].

Here is a short ex of the steps descrived above:
